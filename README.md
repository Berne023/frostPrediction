# Frost Prediction

This problem was given to me as part of a technical test for a data science internship, on December 2016, to be solved in 4 hours maximum. The problem description and goal is given below.

### Goal of the project:
Predict the temperature and whether or not there will be frost at a given day (2 target variables).
Please use a sample of 20% of the data as test set. 

### Data:
See frost_desc.txt for a description of the variables.
fros_data.txt contains the data.

### Remarks:
- You should not use tprev as an explanatory variable. You should rather build your own prediction and compare it with this prediction. 
- You are free to use the performance metric of your choice.
- Please provide some visualizations to show the data.
- Explain your choices. What matters is not the final result but the way you think, code and address the problem.
